# THE MOON AND THE TIDE, PUSH AND PULL

HELLO WORLD!<br>
<br>
You found this on ponytown probably, so here's the basics;
- DO NOT interact with us if you are under 18 (a minor)
- DO NOT involve us in drama, we're not interested in drama between friend groups.
- DO NOT talk to us /j. We're autistic, we don't know how to be normal. We're incredibly blunt and generally unfriendly. This isn't because we hate you, we just don't know how to interact in a "normal" way.
